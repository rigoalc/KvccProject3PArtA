<!--

  Part A (50 Points) - This shows that you can use functions, pass variables around and use the random method of the Math object . 
  
"Math.random()"  It also demonstrates your ability to use a loop! - Please build a JavaScript solution that does the following:

Build a function that will start the program. Please call it main().

From the main() function, call a function called getValue().  

The getValue() function will get a number from the user that will be used in the next step.  You can call it n.

Also from the main() function, call a function called getRandom().  

The getRandom() function will generate a random number n times ... 

using the number n that was input by the user in the getValue() function.  

Generate only random numbers from 1 to 6, inclusive.  

So, if the user put in 12, it would generate 12 random numbers from 1 to 6, inclusive.   

If the user put in 5, it would generate 5 random numbers from 1 to 6, inclusive.

Make sure that you display the results, including the original number and n amount of random numbers, to the user in an easily readable statement.

For extra fun, you could use 6 dice images and show the dice face of the random numbers generated.

<script>

function main()
{
  var userNumber = getValue();
  var msg = getRandom(userNumber);
  document.getElementById("outputPara").innerHTML = msg;
 }

function getValue()
{
  var userNumber = window.prompt("How many numbers do you want to generate?");
  return userNumber;
}

function getRandom(numberGenerated)
{
  var msg = "You have selected to get" + " " + numberGenerated + " " + "numbers:<br>"
  for (i = 0; i < numberGenerated; i++)
  {
    var rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
    switch(rand)
    {
      case 1: msg += "1<br>"; break;
      case 2: msg += "2<br>"; break;
      case 3: msg += "3<br>"; break;
      case 4: msg += "4<br>"; break;
      case 5: msg += "5<br>"; break;
      case 6: msg += "6<br>"; break;
    }
  }
  return msg;
